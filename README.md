# PingHD
A simple cross-platform, no-dependency tool to keep your hard drive alive. 

* Make sure to read the info tab before using this tool by clicking on 'Info(?)' button.

I decided to create this tool as other similar tools that are out there are only built for Windows. This tool was written using FPC/Lazarus which allows for a simple cross-platform deployment.

FPC supports a huge list of platforms, just install fpc compiler for your OS and compile the project with it to produce a single, stand-alone executable of this tool.

Binary executables for Windows and Linux (compiled on Ubuntu 19.10 and Lazarus 2.0.2+dfsg-2 rDebian package 2.0.2+dfsg-2 FPC 3.0.4 x86_64-linux-gtk2) are provided below:
