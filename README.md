# PingHD
A simple cross-platform, no-dependency tool to keep your hard drive alive. 

Make sure to read the info tab before using this tool by clicking on 'Info(?)' button.

I decided to create this tool as other similar tools that I've tried are either or Windows-only and/or written with .NET, so decided to create this using the great tools Lazarus/FPC which allows for a simple cross-platform process.

FPC supports a huge list of platforms, just install fpc compiler for your OS and compile the project with it to produce a single, stand-alone executable of this tool.

I provide binary executables for Windows and Linux (compiled on Ubuntu 19.10 and Lazarus 2.0.2+dfsg-2 rDebian package 2.0.2+dfsg-2 FPC 3.0.4 x86_64-linux-gtk2)
